This is a C# Quantum Virtual Machine. It uses the principles of quantum mechanics to solve various quantum equations.

For now it can solve equations with N qubits, max 4 gates which can be: Pauli-X gate, Pauli-Z gate, Hadamard gate or CNOT gate. The gates are made as matrices.
This quantum VM uses virtual qubits made with complex numbers and virtual quantum circuits consisting of N qubits.
